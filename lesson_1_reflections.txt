How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    it is easy

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a better
programmer in the long term?

    keep track of my work

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
    
    pro is i can see what all changes i had made so far. I can go back to the previous versions
	if require. Con  is there will be many files

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    No idea

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
    
    No idea

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?
    
    since there is a tracking and history, it shows the path of the work

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For all my research work
